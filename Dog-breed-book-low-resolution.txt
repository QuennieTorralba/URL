Dog Breeds of the World

It isn’t possible to put an exact number on the dog breeds of the world, because many varieties can be recognized by one breed registration group but not by another. The World Canine Organization is the largest internationally accepted registry of dog breeds, and they have more than 340 breeds. Dog breeds aren’t scientifical classifications; they’re groupings based on similar characteristics of appearance and behavior. Some breeds have existed for thousands of years, and others are fairly new. Many scientists believe the first dogs were domesticated around 16,000 years ago, but others claim evidence points as far back as 32,000 years. In the latter theory, modern dogs would be related to an ancient type of wolf that is the ancestor of both dogs and modern wolves. 

Does breed matter?
The breed matters to a certain extent. Many people believe that dog breeds mostly have an impact on the outside of the dog, but through the ages breeds have been created based on wanted behaviors such as hunting and herding. It is important to pick a dog that fits the family’s lifestyle. If you want a dog with a special look but the breed characterics seem difficult to handle you might want to look for a mixed breed dog. Dogs are individuals, just like people, but being aware of a breed’s average energy level, exercise needs, or grooming needs can prevent future problems.

Kooikerhondje
The Kooikerhondje is a Dutch breed stemming back to the 1500s. They are also known as Dutch Decoy Dogs and were traditionally used to drive ducks into a trap where the hunter could easily get them. Their name comes from the hunter, who was called Kooiker. The dogs were called the Kooiker’s hondjes – the Kooiker’s dogs – and this became the name of the breed. These dogs are known for being cheerful, well-behaved, friendly, and eager to please. They make great family dogs who adapt quickly and have the ability to change behavior from quiet to lively as the situation calls for it. Since they are a hunting breed, they love outdoor life and need exercise to stay healthy and happy. They need a daily long walk or jog. Even though they can be happy in an apartment, they prefer a fenced-in backyard. Just like all working dogs, the Kooikerhondje gets bored easily, and they require stimulation. It’s much better to give them a task than allow them to make up some form of “work” of their own. They usually reach a height of 14-16 inches and can weigh up to 40 lbs. The average lifespan is 12-14 years. Today, they’re often used as service dogs and for search and rescue. They also excel at agility and obedience. Kooikers are believed to be.

Norwegian Lundehund
The Norwegian Lundehund, also called Norsk Lundehund or the “Puffin Dog,” is a small and agile Spitz with several unique characteristics. It has six toes on each foot, prick ears that fold closed - backwards or forwards at will - and a unique ability to tip its head backwards until it touches the backbone. The head isn’t the only extremely agile part. The Lundehund has a great range of motion in all its joints, allowing it to fit into and get out of narrow passages. The extra toe makes it good at climbing. The Lundehund is described in writing as far back as the 1500s and originated in remote parts of Norway where it was used to wrestle and retrieve live Puffin birds from the crevices of steep vertical cliffs. The extra toe was particularly useful for these balance acts. The breed was as good as extinct after the Second World War, and all dogs alive today stem from five dogs found on a remote island in the Arctic Ocean. No other breed was ever on the island. This is a loyal and playful companion with an excellent personality. They are easy to live with, and their coat requires minimal upkeep. On the downside, Lundehund has a digestive disorder that makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from food. In extreme cases, the dog can starve even though it is well-fed.

Rafeiro do Alentejo
The Rafeiro do Alentejo, also called the Alentejo Mastiff, is an old Portuguese dog breed developed to protect herds of sheep and cattle.

They are affectionate with their family and will bravely protect the people, households, sheep, and cattle they perceive to be under their protection.

Being independent and bred to make decisions on their own, training a Rafeiro do Alentejo requires consistency and patience. They love affection and are eager to receive it but won’t submit to a human’s every whim.

They are generally calm indoors and don’t require excessive amounts of exercise but should get a longer walk or a jog every day. These are very large dogs that weigh up to 135 lbs.

Portuguese Podengo
The Portuguese Podengo is an ancient dog breed believed to stem from dogs brought to Portugal by Phoenician traders around 700 BC. The dogs are hardy, intelligent, fearless, loyal, and energetic. The Portuguese Podengo has developed into three sizes: Pequeno, Medio, and Grande. Each size can be smooth or wire-coated, and the different varieties are not interbred. They’re all referred to as the Portuguese Podengo.

Podengo Grande is the largest with a weight range of 44 to 66 lbs. They were originally developed for hunting deer and wild boar, and they are tough, hardy, and very observant. Nowadays this size is rare, even in Portugal. A Portuguese Podengo Grande needs a Large PlexiDor dog door. Podengo Medio weighs between 35 and 44 lbs. They are great at chasing but can also stalk like a cat and have a funny way of jumping to see over things. They are very active and make great dogs for active families. A smaller Podengo Medio can use a Medium PlexiDor dog door, but large individuals might need a Large PlexiDor dog door. The Podengo Pequeno is the most common in the USA. They are watchful, observant, and very active. Many owners say these dogs are silly and funny indoors. Most Podengo Pequenos will require a Medium PlexiDor dog door.
